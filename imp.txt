Important Note:

I faced alot of dependency issues throughout this project. Some of the issues and their solutions are as follows:

autopy not installing: This is because autopy currently doesn't support Python versions above 3.8
webcam not opening: It was a bug in mediapipe and was fixed in latest python versions
Hence, inorder for the project to run smoothly, you need to degrade the Python version to 3.8

How to Degrade Python Version:
Follow the following steps:

Uninstall Python from add/remove programs
Go to AppData and remove any python folder you see.
Download Python 3.8 from this link : Python 3.8
Install it.
Open command promt and run "pip" inorder to confirm installation.
Your Python version has been degraded....................................
